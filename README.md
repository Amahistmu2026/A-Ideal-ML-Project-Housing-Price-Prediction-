**Installation**

To set up the project environment:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/california-housing-prediction.git
   cd california-housing-prediction
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

**Data **
The project uses the California Housing dataset, which includes features such as median income, housing median age, average rooms, etc. The dataset is automatically downloaded and prepared for use in the notebook.

** Methodology**

The project follows these main steps:

1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature scaling
   - Encoding categorical variables

2. Feature Engineering:
   - Creating new features (e.g., rooms per household, bedrooms-rooms ratio)
   - Selecting relevant features

3. Model Selection:
   - Comparing different algorithms (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests)
   - Cross-validation for model evaluation

4. Hyperparameter Tuning:
   - Using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV for optimizing model parameters

5. Final Model Evaluation:
   - Assessing the best model on the test set

** Models**

The project explores several regression models:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor

The Random Forest Regressor with optimized hyperparameters was found to perform best on this dataset.

** Results**

The final model achieves a root mean squared error (RMSE) of approximately 47,730 on the test set, indicating a reasonably good fit for predicting housing prices in California.

**Usage**

To run the project:

1. Open the Jupyter notebook in the `notebooks/` directory:
   ```
   jupyter notebook notebooks/California_Housing_Price_Prediction.ipynb
   ```

2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to execute the analysis and model training.

3. To use the trained model for predictions, you can import the relevant functions from the `src/` directory in your Python script:

   ```python
   from src.model_training import train_random_forest
   from src.model_evaluation import evaluate_model

   # Train the model
   model = train_random_forest(X_train, y_train)

   # Make predictions
   predictions = model.predict(X_test)

   # Evaluate the model
   rmse = evaluate_model(model, X_test, y_test)
   print(f"Root Mean Squared Error: {rmse}")
   ```
